The Makrana marble was sourced from Rajasthan and contains crystalline structures that interact uniquely with different light wavelengths. UNESCO designated it a World Heritage Site in 1983.",

    detailedFact: "Carved between the 2nd century BCE and 6th century CE, the 30 rock-cut caves were accidentally rediscovered in 1819 by British officer John Smith during a tiger hunt. The paintings depict Jataka tales and are considered masterpieces of Buddhist religious art. Cave 1's famous Padmapani Bodhisattva is often called the 'Mona Lisa of India'.",

    detailedFact: "The Malabar Coast of Kerala was the epicenter of the global spice trade for over 3,000 years. Vasco da Gama's 1498 voyage to Calicut was driven by the desire to bypass Arab middlemen in the spice trade. Today, India exports spices worth over ₹35,000 crores annually.

    detailedFact: "Constructed by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), the road was completed in 2021 and connects Chisumle to Demchok near the India-China border. At this altitude, oxygen levels are approximately 50% of sea level, and temperatures can drop to -40°C in winter. The road surpassed Bolivia's previous record holder by over 300 feet.",

At an altitude of 3,352–3,658 meters, the valley spans 87.5 sq km. The Brahma Kamal, Uttarakhand's state flower, blooms here only at night.

    detailedFact: "Ashoka established rest houses along the Uttarapatha (Grand Trunk Road) every 15 km. The Mughal emperor Sher Shah Suri expanded this system with 1,700 sarais. The concept directly influenced the modern hospitality industry. Today, the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai (1903) is one of Asia's most iconic luxury hotels, and India's hospitality sector contributes over 9% to GDP.",

The temperature at the bottom is 5-6°C cooler than at the surface, making it a natural air conditioning system. It was featured in the films 'The Dark Knight Rises' and 'The Fall'.
